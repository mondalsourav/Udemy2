<p>
    If you are an Instructor, these Instructor Terms & Conditions (the “Instructor Terms”) contain the terms and conditions of Your participation as an Instructor via Udemy’s Services. This is a binding agreement between you and Udemy and is incorporated by reference into Udemy’s Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”).

<p>
    "<b>Base Exchange Rate</b>" means a system-wide rate used by Udemy for foreign currency conversion and does not include any fee or mark-up by Udemy.

</p>
<p>
    "<b>Price Tier Matrix</b>" means the table available in the <a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229232607">Pricing and Promotions Policy</a> which will provide the matrix of Base Prices available from which You can select the Base Price for Your Courses.

</p>


<h2>7. Restricted Persons We Cannot Do Business With</h2>

</p>


<h2>8. Pricing</h2>
<p>
    As an Instructor, You will be responsible for determining the Base Price You charge Students for Your Course(s) from the Price Tier Matrix. You may select any increment as defined in the Price Tier Matrix by going to the Price Edit screen in your Instructor Account. You agree to charge only for Your own Submitted Content. You may not charge separately for any course add-ons such as downloadable PDFs or other content and services (such as providing a link to a third party service to sell downloadable PDFs). The Company will handle billing and other fee interaction with Students. When the Sale Currency is different than the Base Currency, Udemy will determine the Sale Price using the most recently published Price Tier Matrix. The Company reserves the right to make changes to the Price Tier Matrix at any time.
</p>
<p>
    As part of Your participation on Udemy, You give Us permission to share Your Course, and information about You and the Course with Udemy employees and selected partners, for which You will not receive compensation.
</p>
<p>
    Udemy offers certain programs that can help you market your Courses (“Marketing Programs”). Marketing Programs may include, but are not limited to, Udemy's Deals Program and Marketing Boost Program. The complete list and terms of the currently available Marketing Programs are available under our <a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229232607">Pricing and Promotions Policy</a>, which may be updated from time to time. If You choose to participate, the fee You receive from Udemy will be in accordance with the terms of the particular Marketing Program that applies to the sale of Your Course.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge that the amounts paid by Students for Courses sold through Marketing Programs are not fixed, and Udemy has the sole discretion to determine those amounts and which Courses to offer as part of such Marketing Programs. Further, Udemy does not guarantee any minimum level of success in connection with the Marketing Programs, and its selection of Courses to include is not an endorsement of those Courses, or of You. If You do not wish to participate in certain Marketing Programs, log into Your Account and opt out of them.
</p>
<p>
    You may be able to increase Your sales by promoting Your Courses by using a coupon code that You have created on Udemy. For additional information on Instructor created coupons please see Our <a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229232607">Pricing and Promotions Policy</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of Courses offered on Udemy’s iOS application, Udemy will select the Apple App Store price tier (from the App Store Pricing Matrix available at <a href="http://www.equinux.com/us/appdevelopers/pricematrix.html">http://www.equinux.com/us/appdevelopers/pricematrix.html</a>) that is closest to the Base Price set by the Instructor.
</p>


<h2>9. Payments</h2>

<p>
    If You do not opt into any of Udemy’s optional Marketing Programs, We will pay You fifty percent (50%) of the Net Amount received for Your Course less any applicable deductions such as Student refunds (“Standard Revenue Share”). If Udemy changes the Standard Revenue Share, we will provide you thirty (30) days notice via email or prominent notice on the Services.
</p>

<p>
    So that Company can pay you in a timely manner, you must have a PayPal account in good standing and keep Udemy apprised as to the correct email address associated with your PayPal account. Payment will be made within forty-five (45) days of the end of the month in which the fee for a Course was received. You are responsible for providing Company with all identifying and tax information necessary for the payment of amounts due.
</p>

<p>
    As an Instructor, you are responsible for determining whether you are eligible to be paid by a US company.
</p>

<b>Japan Specific Terms</b>

<p>
    The following terms apply to Our Instructors in Japan:
</p>
<p>
    - The Standard Revenue Share to Instructor shall be 33% of the Net Amount received from Instructor’s Course(s).
</p>


<h2>10. Refunds</h2>

<p>
    As an Instructor, you acknowledge and agree that Students have the right to receive a refund, as set forth in section 10 of Udemy’s <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>. Neither Instructors nor Udemy shall receive any payments, fees or commissions for any transactions for which a refund has been granted pursuant to section 10 thereof. In the event that a Student requests a refund for a Course after Udemy has sent an Instructor payment for that Course, Udemy reserves the right to either (1) deduct the amount of such refund from the next payment to be sent to that Instructor, or (2) require that Instructor to refund any amounts refunded to Students for Instructor's Course to the extent no additional payments are due from Udemy to Instructor or such payments due to the Instructor are insufficient to cover the amounts refunded to Students.
</p>


<h2>11. Taxes</h2>

<p>
    You understand and agree that You are responsible for any taxes on Your income. We reserve the right to withhold payment if we do not receive proper tax documentation. With regard to sales tax on the sale of Your Courses, the following applies:
</p>

<h3>1. European Union</h3>

<p>
    In the event that the sale or delivery of a Course or any Submitted Content to any Student in the European Union is subject to any value added tax ("VAT"), under applicable law, Udemy will collect and remit the VAT to the competent tax authorities for sales of such Courses or Submitted Content to Students in the European Union. <b>Udemy may at its Own discretion increase the Sale Price where Udemy is of the view that VAT may be due and Udemy will have a liability to account for such.</b> You will indemnify and hold Udemy harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of VAT, and any penalties and/or interest thereon on Your Instructor Revenue or otherwise.
</p>

<h3>2. All Other Countries</h3>
<p>
    For sales of any Courses or Submitted Content in countries other than the European Union, South Korea and Japan, You are responsible for following the requirements of the appropriate taxing authority related to sales tax on Your Courses (which may be different to the tax authority in Your own location). Udemy is unable to provide You with tax advice and You should consult Your own tax advisor.
</p>

    If You wish to delete Your Instructor Account, You may do so by following the steps provided in the following <a href="/support/229233547/">Instructor instruction page</a>.

</p>


<h2>13. Modifications to These Instructor Terms</h2>

<p>
    From time to time, We may update these Instructor Terms to clarify our practices or to reflect new or different practices, such as when We add new features, and Udemy reserves the right to modify and/or make changes to these Instructor Terms at any time. If We make any material change We will notify You using prominent means such as by email notice sent to the email address specified in Your Account or by posting a notice on Our Services. Other modifications will become effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise. If You continue to use the Services, after the effective date of any change, then such access and/or use will be deemed an acceptance of and an agreement to follow and be bound by the Instructor Terms as changed.
