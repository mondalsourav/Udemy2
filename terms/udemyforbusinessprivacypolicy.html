    <h2 id="Information-You-Provide-To-Us-Directly">1. Information You Provide To Us Directly</h2>

    <p>
        When You sign up for and use the UFB Service
        (including through a Third Party Platform) We will collect any information You provide
        to Us directly such as the following:
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Registration Information:</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Customers: When a Customer signs up for and uses the
        UFB Service, We may collect Customer name and address and the full name and email
        addresses of: the person representing the Customer; Administrators; and authorized
        Users.
    </p>

    <p>
        Administrators and Users: In order to use the UFB
        Service, a User must be authorized by a Customer. Customers may provide Us with a
        User&rsquo;s first name, last name, and e-mail address. You must then register for an
        account (&ldquo;Account&rdquo;), and We will collect and store any registration
        information You share with Us, such as first name, last name, e-mail address, password,
        Your company's name (e.g., Customer name), telephone number, and address information
        (&ldquo;Registration Information&rdquo;). &nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Profile Information:</em>
        Administrators and Users may also have the option of providing additional information
        ("Profile Information") to create a profile ("Profile"). You should exercise care and
        caution in creating Your Profile as such information will be publicly viewable by
        others, including but not limited to other Users, and the Customer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Administrators may add a User to a group of Users
        (&ldquo;Group&rdquo;) and assign the group a name. Any authorized Users of a
        Customer can view such Group name and the Users assigned to such Group.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Administrators and/or Users sign up to use the
        UFB Service, We will assign a unique identifying number ("ID Number&rdquo;) which may
        be publicly displayed to others.
    </p>

    <p>
        Udemy is not responsible for how others use
        information that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to others in the UFB
        Service.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Public Posting / Shared
            Content:</em> The UFB Service may also allow Administrators and
        Users to interact with others, including other Administrators, Users, other Udemy
        users, instructors, teaching assistants, and the Customer and/or post, share,
        communicate or otherwise transmit content publicly, such as by posting comments in a
        course page, sending messages to or chatting with others or posting photos
        (collectively "Shared Content" or "Public Posting"). We may collect and store Public
        Postings and Shared Content. Shared Content or Public Postings may be publicly
        available or viewable by others, including Administrators, Users, or instructors or
        teaching assistants, depending on where such content is posted.
    </p>

    <p>
        You hereby grant Udemy a non-exclusive right and
        license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, offer, market and otherwise use and
        exploit Public Postings and Shared Content.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Course Information:</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        We collect information relating to
        taking courses, including, without limitation, interchanges with instructors, teaching
        assistants, Administrators, and other Users, as well as progress within a course,
        answers, essays and other items submitted to satisfy the course requirements ("Course
        Information").
    </p>

    <p>
        When Customers upload Customer Courses to the UFB
        Service, we collect materials contained in such Customer Courses to make such courses
        available to Users. When a Customer uploads a Customer Course, Customer
        grants Udemy a non-exclusive right and license to reproduce, offer,
        and distribute&nbsp;such Customer Course to Customer&rsquo;s
        authorized Users.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a Customer (or an Administrator on the
        Customer&rsquo;s behalf) selects courses, including a Customer Course course, to make
        available to some or all of its authorized Users or Administrators, we collect such
        information. When a User or Administrator signs up for and/or participates in a
        course, we collect all related Course Information.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may share, and Administrators and Users hereby
        consent to Our sharing of, Course Information with the Customer and Administrators as
        set forth in Section 5 below. The Customer determines how it uses certain Course
        Information of its authorized Users and whether to download, share, and/or retain such
        information. Users should check with the Customer or the Administrator about such
        policies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users and Administrators also consent to Udemy
        providing certain Registration Information and/or Profile Information to the Customer,
        Administrators, and to an instructor or teaching assistant when Users or Administrators
        enroll in a course. Udemy does not provide Administrators&rsquo; or Users&rsquo; email
        addresses or Customer&rsquo;s account names to instructors or teaching assistants.
        Udemy does not control how instructors or teaching assistants treat Registration
        Information, Profile Information, or
        Course Information and is not liable for use by instructors or teaching
        assistants.

        This Technical Information and Usage Data, some of
        which may be linked to Your ID Number, is collected through the use of server log files
        and tracking technologies, such as: (i) cookies, which are small files that websites
        send to Your computer or Wireless Device to uniquely identify Your browser or mobile
        device or to store information in Your browser setting; and (ii) web beacons, which are

        <em>Analytics.</em> We may use
        third-party browser and mobile analytics services on our Service, such as those of
        Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Intercom. These service providers use the sort of
        technology described in this section to help us analyze how users use the Service,
        including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, how often You use the UFB
        Service, the events that occur within the Service,
        aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded
        from. The information (including your IP address) collected
        by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service
        providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the UFB Service
        to allow Us to improve the UFB Service, better understand the
        functionality of the UFB Service on a computer or other device, and to provide
        information that may be of interest to You. To prevent
        Google Analytics from using your information for analytics,
        you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by <a

    <h2 id="How-Do-We-Keep-Your-Information-Secure">6. How Do We Keep Your Information Secure?</h2>

    <p>
        Udemy takes appropriate security measures to protect
        against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction
        of, sensitive data that You share and We collect and store. Unfortunately,
        however, no system can be 100% secured, and We cannot guarantee that communications
        between You and Udemy, the UFB Service, or any information provided to Us in connection
        with the information We collect through the UFB Service will be free from unauthorized
        access by third parties. Your password is an important component of Our security
        system. As such, it is Your responsibility to protect it. Do not share Your password
        with any third parties. If Your password has been compromised for any reason, You
        should change it immediately and contact <a href="mailto:support@udemy.com">support@udemy.com</a>
        with any concerns.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Your-Choices-Regarding-the-Use-of-Your-Information">7. Your Choices Regarding the
        Use of Your Information</h2>

    <p>
        Customers may instruct us as to what to do with certain
        information. A Customer has many choices and control over information in its account.
        For example, Customer may enable or disable a User&rsquo;s access to the UFB Service,
        import courses, select certain courses, export certain Course Information, manage
        permissions such as administrative rights, and run reports on the UFB Service. These
        choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or
        deletion of certain information.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can always choose not to provide certain
        information to Us but You may not be able to use certain features of the UFB Service.
        If You do not wish to receive promotional communications from Us, You can opt- out by:
        (i) following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the promotional communication
        You receive; or (ii) managing Your e-mail preferences by signing into Your Account,
        clicking on the Account Settings link in under Your Profile button in the site header,
        and navigating to the Notifications tab.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that despite Your opt-out choice or
        indicated email preferences, We will still send You administrative messages regarding
        the UFB Service, including, for example, administrative confirmations, order
        confirmation, important updates regarding the UFB Service, notices from the Customer,
        and notices regarding our policies.

    <h2 id="How-We-Respond-to-Do-Not-Track-Signals">8. How We Respond to Do-Not-Track Signals</h2>

    <p>
        Because consumers are often unaware that their
        do-not- track beacons are active, do-not-track does not frequently reflect the actual
        preferences of Our Users. Accordingly, Udemy does not respond to the federal do-not-
        track signal. If You would like to not receive promotional communication from Udemy,
        You are free to follow the procedure described in the previous section to
        unsubscribe.

    </p>

    <p>
        If You continue to use the UFB Service, after the

        of and an agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy as changed. The

    <p>
        Cookies are small text files placed onto your computer
        or device as you browse the Internet. Cookies can be used to collect, store and share
        bits of information about your activities across websites and services, including on
        the UFB Service. They also allow us to remember things about your visit to the

        make the site easier for you to use.
    </p>

    <p>
        Udemy uses both session cookies and persistent cookies.
        A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to the UFB Service. These
        cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using the
        UFB Service. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session,
        such as when you log into the UFB Service. A persistent cookie will remain on your
        devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie. We use these cookies where we
        need to identify you over a longer period of time. For example, we would use a
        persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.

    <p>
        <strong>Why does Udemy use cookies and similar
            technologies?</strong>

        For example, cookies help us test different versions of
        the UFB Service to see which particular features or content users prefer. We may
        include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message
        has been opened and for other analytics. We might also optimize and improve your
        experience on the UFB Service by using cookies to see how you interact with the UFB
        Service, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click
        on.
    </p>

    <p>
        To help us better understand how people use the UFB Service, we
        work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics and Mixpanel.
        These providers use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users
        use the Services, including by noting the third-party Services from which you arrive.
        The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these
        service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the UFB Service.

        We don&rsquo;t release the information collected from
        our own cookies to any third parties, other than to our service providers who assist us
        in these cookie activities.
