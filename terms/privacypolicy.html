    <h2>8. When and How We May Share/Disclose Your Information with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      We will only share Your information (including personal information) with the following third parties or under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>1. Safety, Security, Cooperation with Law Enforcement, & Compliance with Legal Obligations</i><br/> We may disclose Your information to third parties, including Your personal information, if We, in our sole discretion, have a good faith belief that disclosure is: (1) permitted or required by law; (2) requested in connection with or relevant to a judicial, governmental or legal inquiry, investigation, order, or proceeding; (3) required or reasonably necessary pursuant to a valid subpoena, warrant or other legally valid inquiry or request; (4) reasonably necessary to enforce Our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any other legal agreements; (5) required to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential violations of law (or rule/regulation), and/or security or technical issues; or (6) required or reasonably necessary to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Udemy, Our Users, employees, any minors, members of the public and/or our Services. We may also disclose information about You to Our auditors or legal advisors in conjunction with accessing Our disclosure obligations and/or rights under this Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>2. Third Party Business Partners, Service Providers, Contractors or Agents</i><br/> We may share Your information with third party companies that perform services on Our behalf, including payment processing, order fulfillment, data analysis, marketing services, e-mail campaigns, hosting services, and customer service. While providing the services for Us, these companies may access Your personal information, and are required to use it solely as directed by Us for the purpose of Our requested service. We may also share Your information with third party companies that we partner with to provide certain services to You in connection with the Services, including but not limited to Estacio, Benesse or other similar partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>3. Business Transfers, Sales, Mergers, or Divestitures</i><br/> In the event that Udemy undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, We may share, disclose or transfer all of Your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in such transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>4. Promotions</i><br/> We may share Your information in connection with any promotion You enter on or through the Services, as necessary to administer, market, sponsor, or fulfill the promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners' lists or make required filings as appropriate) or in accordance with the applicable rules of the promotion/sweepstakes You enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>5. With Your Permission</i><br/> Additionally, if You opt-in or otherwise agree to have Your information shared with a third party for marketing purposes, We will share Your information with the third party (or third parties) in which case the third party's use of Your information is subject to the third party's own privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>6. Advertising of Third Party Products/Services</i><br/> While we do not currently offer advertising on the Services, if we do offer advertising in the future, we may use and share with third party advertisers (and other third parties) certain Technical Information and/or Aggregate Information to show general demographic and preference information among our Users. We may also allow advertisers to collect Technical Information or Aggregate Information, which they may share with Us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer You targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize Your User experience by increasing the likelihood that advertisements for products and services You see will appeal to You, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end User activity to improve Your experience). To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising for participating ad networks, You can visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"> Network Advertising Initiative website</a>. If You are located in the European Union and would like to opt- out, please visit, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">this page</a>. Please note this does not opt You out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>7. Social Media Features</i><br/> Our Web site may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button. These features may collect Your IP address, which page You are visiting when using Our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly through the use of Our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
    </p>
    <h2>9. How Do We Keep Your Information Secure?</h2>
    <p>
      Udemy takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, sensitive data that You share and We collect and store. These security measures may include practices such as keeping Your sensitive data on a secured server behind a firewall, transmitting sensitive information (such as a credit card number) entered on Our Services using secure socket layer technology (SSL), internal reviews of Our data collection practices and platforms, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where We store Your information. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, and We cannot guarantee that communications between You and Udemy, the Services, or any information provided to Us in connection with the information We collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of User information at any time. Your password is an important component of Our security system. As such, it is Your responsibility to protect it. Do not share Your password with any third parties. If Your password has been compromised for any reason, You should change it immediately and contact <a href="mailto:support@udemy.com" id="" class="">support@udemy.com</a> with any concerns.
    </p>
    <h2>10. Your Choices Regarding The Use of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      As discussed, You can always choose not to provide certain information to Us but You may not be able to use certain features of the Services. If You do not wish to receive promotional communications from Us, You can opt- out by: (i) following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the promotional communication You receive; or (ii) managing Your e-mail preferences by signing into Your Account on the Udemy.com site, clicking on the Account Settings link in under Your Profile button in the site header, and navigating to the Notifications tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that despite Your opt-out choice or indicated email preferences, We will still send You administrative messages regarding the Services, including, for example, administrative confirmations, order confirmation, important updates regarding the Services, and notices regarding our policies.
    </p>
    <h2>11. How We Respond to Do-Not-Track Signals</h2>
    <p>
      Because consumers are often unaware that their do-not- track beacons are active, do-not-track does not frequently reflect the actual preferences of Our Users. Accordingly, Udemy does not respond to the federal do-not- track signal. If You would like to receive no promotional communication from Udemy, You are free to follow the procedure described in the previous section to unsubscribe.
    </p>
    <h2>12. How to Access & Update Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      You may access and update Your information that Udemy collects and maintains in the following ways:
    </p>
    <p>

Information We Receive from a Third Party Platform or Wireless Device</i><br/> To manage the information Udemy receives about You from a Third Party Platform or Wireless Device, please follow the instructions provided by the Third Party Platform or Wireless Device provider for updating Your information and changing Your privacy settings. Once Udemy receives Your information from a Third Party Platform or Wireless Device, that information is stored and used by Udemy in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>2. Information We Receive Directly from You</i><br/> You may update the information You provide directly to Udemy by logging into Your Account and updating Your Account information.
    </p>
    <p>
