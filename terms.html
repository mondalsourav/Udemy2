    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, if You are an Instructor (as defined below), You are also subject to the <a href="instructortermsandconditions.html">Instructor Terms</a>, which are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms. If You are an Instructor, and there is a conflict between these Terms and the Instructor Terms, the Instructor Terms will govern.
    </p>
    <h2>3. General</h2>
    <p>
      Our Services enable students ("Students") to connect with independent contractor instructors (the "Instructors", collectively with Students, the "Users") who provide live and recorded instruction, tutoring, and learning services (the "Courses") via Our Services. The Services include, without limitation, facilitating and hosting Courses and supporting materials, and taking feedback from Users.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, We may update these Terms to clarify our practices or to reflect new or different practices, such as when We add new features, and Udemy reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify and/or make changes to these Terms at any time. If We make any material change to these Terms, We will notify You using prominent means such as by email notice sent to the email address specified in Your Account or by posting a notice through Our Services. Modifications will become effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your continued use of Our Services after changes become effective shall mean that You accept those changes. You should visit the Services regularly to ensure You are aware of the latest version of the Terms, as any revised Terms shall supersede all previous Terms.
    <p>
      Udemy may modify the Services or discontinue their availability at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for all service, telephony, data charges and/or other fees and costs associated with Your access to and use of the Services, as well as for obtaining and maintaining all telephone, computer hardware, and other equipment required for such access and use.
    </p>
    <p>
      If You elect to access or use Our Services that involve payment of a fee, then You agree to pay, and will be responsible for payment of, that fee and all taxes associated with such access or use. If You provide credit card information to pay for such fees then You hereby represent and warrant that You are authorized to supply such information and hereby authorize Udemy to charge Your credit card on a regular basis to pay the fees as they are due.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Your payment method fails or Your Account is past due, then We may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. This may include charging other payment methods on file with Us and/or retaining collection agencies and legal counsel. We may also block Your access to any Services pending resolution of any amounts due by You to Udemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of Your use, access and other activities relating to the Services must be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitations, laws relating to copyright and other intellectual property use, and to privacy and personal identity. Further, access to Our Services from territories where their contents are illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access or use the Services from locations outside of the United States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all local rules including, without limitation, rules about the internet, data, e-mail, or privacy. You further agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which You reside. If You use the Services or Third Party Platforms (as defined in the next section) from countries outside of the United States You must agree to abide by all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable content.

    </p>
    <h2>10. Pricing, Payment & Taxes</h2>
    <h3><i>1. Pricing.</i></h3>
    <p>
      Pricing of Udemy Courses is determined in accordance with the terms set forth in Our <a href="instructortermsandconditions.html">Instructor Terms</a> and Our <a href="#">Pricing and Promotions Policy</a>. If You are a Student, You agree to pay the fees for Courses that You purchase, and hereby authorize Us to charge Your credit card for such fees. If Your credit card is declined, You agree to pay Us the fees within thirty (30) days of notification from Us, and pay (at Our discretion) a late payment charge of 1.5% per month, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is greater.
    </p>
    <h3><i>2. Payment.</i></h3>
    <p>
      All payments are made to Udemy, Inc.
    </p>
    <p>
        European Union Users. By purchasing Courses (e.g. clicking or tapping the relevant purchase button), You are confirming that You want the Course immediately credited to Your Account and that by doing so You are hereby waiving any and all cancellation rights under applicable laws, including but not limited to the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU) and/or any national laws implementing it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You will still be eligible for the 30 day refund right as set forth in this section 10. For avoidance of any doubt, refunds to You shall be applicable only in accordance with our refund policy described in this section 10.
    </p>
    <h3><i>3. Taxes.</i></h3>
    <p>
      European Union. In the event that the sale or delivery of a Course or any Submitted Content to any Student in the European Union is subject to any value added tax ("VAT"), under applicable law, Udemy will collect and remit the VAT to the competent tax authorities for sales of such Courses or Submitted Content to Students in the European Union. Udemy may at its own discretion increase the Sale Price where Udemy is of the view that VAT may be due and Udemy will have a liability to account for such. You will indemnify and hold Udemy harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of VAT, and any penalties and/or interest thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
        All Other Countries. For sales of any Courses or Submitted Content in countries other than the European Union, You are responsible for remitting the taxes to the appropriate taxing authority (which may be different to the tax authority in Your own location). Udemy is unable to provide You with tax advice and You should consult Your own tax advisor.
    </p>
    <h3><i>4. Rounding Off.</i></h3>
    <p>
      Udemy may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down the Sale Price to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the Sale Currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Udemy will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Udemy may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Udemy to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.
    </p>
    <h3><i>5. Foreign Currency.</i></h3>
    <p>
      When browsing without logging in to Your Account, the Services will default the Sale Currency to the currency used in Your current geographic location. When you are logged in to Your Account, the Sale Currency will be based on Your geographic location as set upon Account signup. You cannot change Your displayed currency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each foreign currency conversion is processed at a foreign currency conversion rate. This rate generally refers to the amount of one currency that must be paid to buy a certain amount of another currency at a given time. For example, if it costs US$125.00 to buy €100.00, the currency conversion rate of US dollars to Euros would be 1.25, and the currency conversion rate from Euros to US dollars would be 0.8. Currency conversion rates will vary from time to time.
    </p>
    <h3><i>6. Refunds.</i></h3>
    <p>
      Udemy offers Students a thirty (30)-day, no-questions- asked money back guarantee on Courses that are purchased on the Udemy website (at <a href="#">www.udemy.com</a>) or via Android applications. Any Courses purchased through Third Party Platforms or the iOS application will not be eligible for refunds. If You, as a Student, are unhappy with such a Course and request a refund within thirty (30) days of the date that You paid for access to that Course, We will provide You with a full refund of the amount You paid. To request a refund, please contact Us via <a href="#" id="" class="">support@udemy.com</a>. Please note that if We believe that You are abusing Our refund policy in Our sole discretion, We reserve the right to suspend or terminate Your Account and refuse or restrict any and all current or future use of the Services, without any liability to You.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are an Instructor, you acknowledge and agree that Students have the right to receive a refund as set forth in this section. See <a href="#">Instructor Terms</a> for additional information on refunds.

    <h2>17. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Entire Agreement.</i> These Terms and any policies applicable to You posted on Our Services constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Severability.</i> If any provision of these Terms is found to be illegal, void or unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions of these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Waiver.</i> A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. The failure of Udemy to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Notice.</i> Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given by facsimile, postpaid registered or certified mail return receipt requested, or electronic mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>No Agency.</i> Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as making either party the partner, joint venture, agent, legal representative, employer, contractor or employee of the other. Neither Udemy nor any other party to these Terms shall have, or hold itself out to any third party as having, any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action that shall be binding on the other except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound.

    </p>
    <h2>18. Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver</h2>
    <p>
      THIS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO USERS IN THE US AND CANADA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our support team at <a href="#" id="" class="">support@udemy.com</a>. Most disputes can be resolved that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>We Both Agree to Arbitrate.</i> If we can't resolve our dispute amicably, You and Udemy agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms, or any of Our other terms posted on Our Services from time to time, through final and binding arbitration. This applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either of Us can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where You live, or some other place we both agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, if You or Udemy brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of Us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of Us can ask a court to force Us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). You or Udemy may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>No Class Actions.</i> We all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. That means: (a) neither You nor Udemy can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action or representative action; (b) an arbitrator cannot combine more than one person's claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this); (c) an arbitrator's decision or award in one person's case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other Users, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other Users. If a court decides that this subsection on "No Class Actions" is not enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver) will be null and void, but, the rest of the Terms will still apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Arbitration Process.</i> Any disputes between You and Udemy relating to the Services that involve a claim of less than US$10,000 must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance- based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. In addition, You and Udemy agree that the following rules shall apply to the arbitration proceedings: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any disputes between You and Udemy relating to the Services that involve a claim of less than US$10,000 must be resolved in accordance with the AAA's rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be in-person.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jurisdiction for Legal Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration.</i> If the Agreement to Arbitrate is determined to be invalid or unenforceable or for any disputes that do not qualify for arbitration, the dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in San Francisco, California. You hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Changes.</i> Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if Udemy changes this "Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Udemy written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: Udemy, Inc. Attn: Legal, 600 Harrison Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94107, or by email from the email address associated with your Account to: <a href="#">privacy@udemy.com</a>, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated by the "last updated on" language above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Udemy in accordance with the provisions of this "Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
