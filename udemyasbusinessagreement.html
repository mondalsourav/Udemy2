 <h1>Udemy for Business Agreement</h1>
    <p>THIS UDEMY-FOR-BUSINESS PORTAL AND SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (the "<b>AGREEMENT</b>") CONTAINS
        THE EXCLUSIVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BETWEEN UDEMY, INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION
        (<b>"COMPANY"</b>) AND YOU (AND THE ORGANIZATION YOU REPRESENT) (<b>"CUSTOMER"</b>) AND IT
        GOVERNS THE CUSTOMER’S ACCESS AND USE OF THE COMPANY’S CUSTOMER PORTAL SERVICE AND RELATED
        SERVICES (collectively, the<b>"SERVICE"</b>). BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, THE
        CUSTOMER IS CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY AND BECOME A PARTY TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
        AGREEMENT. <b>IF THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE
            CUSTOMER MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.</b></p>
    <h2>1. UFB Service.</h2>
    <p>Udemy offers various online courses at its primary website located at
        <a href="index.html">www .udemy.com</a>
        (the "Site"). Udemy also offers the Service under the name "Udemy for Business" that permits
        other entities to create their own portals to the Site, populate them with courses, and
        allow their employees to access and enroll in courses through that portal. The Service
        includes the tools and/or documentation needed to access the portal, customize the portal,
        post custom courses and other content through the portal, and other features of Udemy for
        Business service that Udemy makes available to Customer as described at
        <a href="terms.html">www.udemy.com/terms/</a>
        . This Agreement refers to the portal page Customer creates using the Service as the
        "Customer Portal," and the employees and other persons Customer allows to use the Customer
        Portal as "Users."
    </p>
    <h2>2. Customer Portal.</h2>
    <p>The Customer Portal will be based on a template that is co-branded. Customer shall select a
        unique URL identifier for the Customer Portal; establish User names, passwords and maintain
        their security. Customer will be liable for any breach of security caused by its conduct,
        and will indemnify and hold harmless Udemy from any third party claims of infringement
        relating to the Customer identifier. Udemy may include Customer in a list of customers and
        identify Customer online as a user of the Service. Customer will appoint an administrator
        for the Customer Portal that will be responsible for its supervision, determining the
        courses offered, setting up User accounts and monitoring them, and other similar activities.
        Udemy will make available various tools to permit the administrator to perform these
        activities. </p>
    <h2>3. Available Courses.</h2>
    <p>Using the Service, Customer may populate the Customer Portal with different types of courses
        and related content. These include: (i) courses that Udemy generally offers on the Site
        ("Standard Courses") for the fees (if any) associated with each Standard Course ("Standard
        Course Fees"); (ii) courses that Customer creates using the Service ("Customer Courses"),
        for fees (if any) that Customer elects to charge Users ("Customer Course Fees"); and (iii)
        courses packaged into bundles that Customer subscribes to (each a "Course Subscription") for
        fixed fees instead of Standard Course Fees ("Subscription Fees"). All courses are subject to
        any restrictions put on them by the instructors for such courses, and to the obligations
        contained in the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy set forth on the Site.
        Customer shall be responsible for the content contained in Customer Courses. Upon
        termination of this Agreement, enrolled Users will still be able to access Standard Courses
        and, subject to Customer’s consent, Customer Courses as independent users of the Site.
        Courses available through a Course Subscription are only available for as long as (a)
        Customer continues to pay the Subscription Fees for that Course Subscription; and (b) Udemy
        continues to have the right to offer those Courses as part of a Course Subscription;
        provided, however, that if Udemy no longer has that right it will use its best efforts to
        secure a transition period and the right for enrolled Users to continue to access those
        Courses during that transition period from the Course provider, and will endeavor to give
        notice of such a transition as far in advance as possible. </p>
    <h2>4. Accessing the Service and the Customer Portal.</h2>
    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Udemy gives Customer access to the
        Service for the purpose of using the Service, creating a Customer Portal with the Service,
        and operating that Customer Portal, all in accordance with any documentation that Udemy
        provides. In addition to this Agreement, the right to access and use if the Service and the
        Customer Portal is subject to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy set
        forth on the Site. The use of the Customer Portal by Customer employees is also governed by
        the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy as they apply to Users of the Site.
        Udemy will endeavor to make the Customer Portal and any courses accessed through the
        Customer Portal available 24x7 (subject to planned maintenance downtime). Customer will be
        entitled to receive email support for the Service at all times, and voicemail support from
        8:30a.m-5:00p.m. Pacific Time, Monday to Friday (except business holidays). </p>
    <h2>5. Restrictions.</h2>
    <p>In the course of using the Service and operating the Customer Portal, Customer shall not (and
        shall not permit Users to): provide incorrect or knowingly false information; copy,
        distribute, modify, reverse engineer, deface, tarnish, mutilate, hack, or interfere with the
        Site or Service or any courses (other than Customer Courses); frame or embed the Site,
        Service, Customer Portal or any courses; introduce any virus, worm, spyware or any other
        computer code, file or program that may or is intended to damage or hijack the operation of
        any hardware, software or telecommunications equipment, or any other aspect of the Site or
        Service; scrape, spider, use a robot or other automated means of any kind to access the
        Site, Service or courses; rent, timeshare, lease or otherwise permit third parties other
        than Users to access or use the Service or Customer Portal. If Customer’s access to the
        Service is based on a number of Users, then all such Users must be Customer employees or
        full-time contractors, and User access cannot be assigned or transferred from one employee
        to another employee except in connection with a change of job assignment or termination of
        employment. </p>
    <h2>6. Fees and Payment.</h2>
    <p>Customer will pay Udemy the fees for the services and activities under this Agreement. The
        terms of these fees shall be agreed to by the Customer at the same time it agrees to this
        Agreement. You agree to pay the fees for an entire Term, even if you cancel this Agreement
        anytime during a Term. All fees shall be paid in US dollars and are non-refundable. Fixed
        fees are payable in advance for the period of the plan selected. Recurring fees are due
        within fifteen (15) days of the beginning of each month or other period. Late payments shall
        be subject to 1.5% interest per month (or the maximum permitted by law). Customer shall be
        responsible for any sales, value-added, services, use or similar taxes (other than taxes on
        Udemy’s income). If Customer elects to pay fees by credit or debit card or direct funds
        transfer, then Customer hereby authorizes Udemy or its third-party payment processor to
        charge such card or account. Customer shall provide Udemy or its third-party payment
        processor with all necessary billing, card and account information. </p>
    <h2>7. Confidentiality.</h2>
    <p>Customer acknowledges that, in the course of activities under this Agreement, Customer will
        obtain information relating to Udemy and the Service which is confidential in nature
        ("Confidential Information"), including, but not limited to, the Service features, pricing
        details, and other features and information about the Site’s operations. Udemy acknowledges
        that it may obtain Confidential Information relating to Customer, including, but not limited
        to, Customer Courses. Each party ("Recipient") agrees that it will not disclose Confidential
        Information of the other party ("Discloser") without the prior written consent of Discloser
        unless such Confidential Information becomes part of the public domain through no fault of
        the Recipient, and that it will only use such Confidential Information for the purposes of
        this Agreement and in accordance with the Privacy Policy and applicable law. Each party
        acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of the Confidential Information, there
        can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of this section, and the Discloser shall be
        entitled to equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it may have at law. Nothing in
        this Agreement is intended to limit either party from accessing or making available similar
        services or courses, including, without limitation, Customer’s (or Customer’s employees’)
        use of another online education site, or Udemy from offering Users the opportunity to enroll
        in courses other than the courses available on the Customer Portal. If Customer offers any
        suggestions for changes or improvements of the Service, Udemy shall be free to incorporate
        or use them without payment, and Customer hereby grants Udemy an irrevocable, perpetual,
        royalty-free license to do so. </p>
    <h2>8. Term/Termination.</h2>
    <p>This Agreement will commence on the date the Customer agrees to this Agreement. The initial
        Term of this Agreement will be one year, and then this Agreement will renew automatically
        for additional terms of one year periods until terminated by at least thirty (30) days’
        notice prior to the end of the then-current term. Either party may terminate the Agreement
        upon thirty (30) days’ notice for a material breach unless such breach is cured during the
        notice period. Upon termination for any reason, Customer will cease to use the Customer
        Portal and the Service, each party will cease to use the other’s Confidential Information.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Users are taking Standard Courses that are generally
        available on the Site at the time of termination then Udemy will continue to allow those
        Users to complete those Standard Courses, subject to payment of any required fees and
        compliance with the Site Terms of Use. Sections 5 and 7-12 of this Agreement, as well as any
        accrued rights to payment, will survive any expiration or termination. </p>
    <h2>9. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.</h2>
    <p>UDEMY AND CUSTOMER EACH PROVIDES THE SERVICES, COURSES, AND OTHER MATERIALS HEREUNDER "AS IS"
        AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE SERVICE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, OR SECURITY. </p>
    <h2>10. LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.</h2>
    <p>NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS
        AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
        LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY (A) FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA OR, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF
        SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF REVENUES AND LOSS OF PROFITS, OR
        (C) ANY LIABILITY HEREUNDER IN EXCESS OF THE FEES PAID IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO
        THE DATE A CLAIM AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITS SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING FROM
        CUSTOMER’S BREACH OF SECTION 5, EITHER PARTY’S BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR UNDER THE
        INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. </p>
    <h2>11. Indemnification.</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of this section, all materials that a party provides to the other or
        otherwise makes available pursuant to this Agreement shall be that party’s "Content." The
        Service and Site shall be Udemy’s Content. The Customer Courses shall be Customer Content.
        Standard Courses and Subscription Courses shall not be either party’s Content. Each party
        (the "Indemnifying Party") shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party and its
        employees, directors, affiliates and agents (the "Indemnified Parties") from any claims,
        allegations, investigations, losses, damages and fees (including court costs and attorneys’
        fees) ("Claims") arising from the infringement of the Indemnifying Party’s Content by a
        third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or other intellectual
        property or proprietary rights; provided, however, that the Indemnified Parties (a) gives
        the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of the Claim; (b) allow the Indemnifying Party sole
        control of the defense or settlement of the Claim; and (c) assist with such defense or
        settlement at the Indemnifying Party’s expense. In the event that the Service or Site
        becomes subject to a Claim or Udemy believes will become subject to a Claim, Udemy may elect
        to (i) defend or settle the Claim as above; (ii) procure the right for Customer to continue
        to use the Service or Site without material reduction in functionality; (iii) modify the
        Service or Site to preclude the Claim; or (iv) terminate this Agreement and refund <i>pro
            rata</i> for the remainder of the then-current term any prepaid fees. THE FOREGOING IS
        THE SOLE REMEDY FOR CONTENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. </p>
    <h2>12. Miscellaneous.</h2>
    <p>Udemy may announce that Customer is a user of UFB and the Site, post Customer’s name and logo
        on its website, and, with Customer’s consent, in promotional materials, subject to
        Customer’s usage standards. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall
        be held unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
        necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. This
        Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject
        matter hereof, and any and all written or oral agreements previously existing between the
        parties are expressly cancelled. Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this
        Agreement are assignable or transferable by either party without consent, except in
        connection with an acquisition of that party, or merger or other change of control
        transaction. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without
        regard to its conflicts of laws provisions and any legal claim, suit, action or proceeding
        arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated hereunder or the breach thereof,
        whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the internal
        laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
        provision or rule and shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United
        States or the courts of the State of California in each case located in the City and County
        of San Francisco, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
        courts in any such suit, action or proceeding and waives any objection based on improper
        venue or forum non conveniens. EACH PARTY RECOGNIZES THAT THE DISCLAIMERS, LIABILITY LIMITS
        AND REMEDIES SET FORTH HEREIN ARE MATERIAL, BARGAINED FOR BASES FOR EACH PARTY’S DECISION TO
        ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
